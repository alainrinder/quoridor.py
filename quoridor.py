# TODO: 
# OK Use GridCoordinates class instead of col/row
# OK Param graphical interface (disable draw functions...)
# OK Split source files
#    Handle exec params
# OK Check if fence placing will not block a player
# OK Create algorithms for path finding
#    BuilderBot: maximise other pawns path
# OK PERFORMANCE ISSUES: store valid fence placings, valid pawn moves with updates
# OK Check blocking fence using path without pawns (one path could exist but cannot be currently accessible because of a pawn) (DFS)
# OK Blocking fence checking failed on testing path with the future fence -> update valid pawn moves when appending fence in method isFencePlacingBlocking
